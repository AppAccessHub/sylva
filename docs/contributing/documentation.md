Sylva's [API reference][api_reference] is generated from docstrings in the source code. With this, all classes, members, attributes, and functions that are exposed to the user in a programmatic way are required to have [Google-style docstrings][google_style_docstrings]. When useful, [admonitions] are also supported and recommended.

The [sylva.handler.Handler][] class is a prime example of how these docstrings with admonitions are used, and how they are presented in the documentation. [[source]][handler_source]{target="_blank"} [[rendered]][handler_rendered]{target="_blank"}
