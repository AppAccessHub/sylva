# Contributing to Oculus

The purpose of these guidelines is twofold:
- To streamline the review process, allowing us to merge your contributions more quickly and efficiently.
- To ensure that changes are easily understood even years after they were made, by nothing more than the blame.

All thoughtful contributions are welcome and appreciated. Newcomers who aren't sure where to start are encouraged to look for issues labeled [good first issue][good_first_issue] for an easy introduction.

Note that these are just guidelines, and reasonable deviation is often acceptable. Just let us know. Sometimes things fall outside of the normal scope of this document.

> [!NOTE]
> The keywords __MUST__, __MUST NOT__, __SHOULD__, __SHOULD NOT__, and __MAY__ are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119][rfc2119].

## General Guidelines

- All pull requests __SHOULD__ adhere to the [Conventional Commits Specification][conventional_commits_spec].
- Contributors __SHOULD__ strive for one commit per realistic change, and one realistic change per commit. For instance, if you add two new functions and fix a bug, the most reasonable number of commits would likely be three.
- Contributors __SHOULD__ open an [issue][issues] or [discussion][discussions] prior to starting work on a new feature or large refactor, to ensure the work is in line with the project's goals.

## License

Contributors __MUST__ agree that their patch will be licensed under the project's current license, and that the maintainers of the project are free to relicense the project as deemed appropriate.

With the project in its infancy, we may decide a different license is more appropriate for the project. Once we're satisifed with the current license being the most appropriate, this message will be removed.
